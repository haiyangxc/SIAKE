# SIAKE

### Supersingular Isogeny based Authenticated Key Exchange
SIAKE is an authenticated key exchange based on supersingular isogenies. 
It is an implimentation of SIAKE_2 in [XXW+19]

### The unauthenticated key exchange is based on that in Supersingular Isogeny Key Encapsulation software

We use parameter from SIKE(https://sike.org/), a third round candidate of NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization.

# SIAKE

### Supersigular Isogeny based Authentecated Key Excahnge
SIAKE is an authentecated key excahnge based on supersigular isogenies. 
It is an implimentation of SIAKE_2 in [XXW+19]

[XXW+19] Xiu Xu, Haiyang Xue, Kunpeng Wang, Man Ho Au, Song Tian: Strongly Secure Authenticated Key Exchange from Supersingular Isogenies. ASIACRYPT (1) 2019: 278-308.

### The unauthenticated key exchange is based on that in Supersingular Isogeny Key Encapsulation software

We use parameter SIKEp751 from SIKE(https://sike.org/), a third round candidate of NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization.
